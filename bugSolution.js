```javascript
//Correct usage of $inc operator with $setOnInsert to handle cases where the field doesn't exist.
db.collection('myCollection').updateOne({"_id":ObjectId("651234567890")},{
    $inc:{quantity:1},
    $setOnInsert:{quantity:1}
});
//This query now ensures the quantity field is created and set to 1 if it doesn't exist, and otherwise it is incremented.
```
